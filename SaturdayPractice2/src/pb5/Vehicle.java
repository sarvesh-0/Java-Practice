/*
There is a loan and insurance provider company named ABC. They want to automate the process of issuing loan and giving insurance
Create a class Vehicle with private data members --vehicleNo(int), modelName(String), vehicleType(String), price(double). 
Write four parameterized constructor. Vehicle type can be -"4 wheeler", "3wheeler" or "2 wheeler".
Create a public interface Loan with abstract method double issueloan()
Create a public interface Insurance with abstract method double takeinsurance()
Vehicle class should implement both interfaces.
Provide implementation of respective methods of the interfaces. 
issueloan() method:
Vehicle type - 4 wheeler, eligible loan amount is 75% of price
Vehicle type - 3 wheeler, eligible loan amount is 70% of price
Vehicle type 2 wheeler, eligible loan amount is 60% of price
takeinsurance() method:
Call the method Show()] from main() method
Vehicle price <= 150000, insurance amount is 4000
Vehicle price >= 150000 and <= 300000 insurance amount is 4500
Vehicle price > 300000, insurance amount is 6000.
Write a TestVehicle class to test theÂ functionality.
